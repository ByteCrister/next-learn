# Fix Event Validation Error: Handle Tasks Validation from Frontend

## Current Issue
- Backend validation fails when creating events without tasks: "Event validation failed: tasks: An event should have at least one task"
- Frontend form has Yup validation but backend API doesn't handle tasks properly
- Need to ensure tasks are sent from frontend and handled in backend

## Tasks to Complete

### Backend Changes
- [x] Update POST /api/events/route.ts to accept `tasks` in request body
- [x] Include tasks when creating new Event in database
- [x] Add better error handling for validation failures with specific error messages

### Frontend Changes
- [ ] Enhance EventModal.tsx validation to ensure at least one task with non-empty title
- [ ] Add client-side check before form submission to prevent empty tasks
- [ ] Add error display for backend validation errors in the modal
- [ ] Improve user feedback when tasks are invalid or missing

### Testing
- [ ] Test creating event with valid tasks
- [ ] Test creating event with empty tasks (should show validation error)
- [ ] Test creating event with tasks having empty titles (should show validation error)
- [ ] Verify error messages are user-friendly
